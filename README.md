# Meme Me

This project was created by Daniel Riehs as part of Udacity.com's ios Developer Nanodegree program.

The app lets a user to take a picture and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The meme can then be shared and saved. Saved apps are viewable in a table view and a collection view.

Since submitting the project to Udacity, the app has been modified to persist the memes using Core Data.
