# Meme Me

This project was created by Daniel Riehs as part of Udacity.com's ios Developer Nanodegree program.

The app lets a user take a picture and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The meme can then be shared and saved. Saved memes are viewable in a table view and a collection view.

Note: In this branch, memes are persisted using NSCoding / NSKeyedâ€‹Archiver. (In the master branch, memes are persisted with Core Data.)
